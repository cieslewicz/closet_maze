Closet Maze

Let’s build a web game together that works on mobile and desktop.

In this game 3d shape characters are controlled by the user and have to navigate a maze. The game is controlled from the third person (you can see the character) but you are in a 3d maze so you cannot see everything. Kind of like a 1st person shooter (but no shooting!).

In the maze there are closets that your character can enter to hide. 

There is a bad guy in the maze (also a shape) and if he catches you, you lose.

If you hide in a closet the bad guy loses interest and moves on.

The bad guy also cannot see everything in the maze and will wander randomly until they spot you at which point they will follow you unless you find a closet and hide or otherwise get away.

When you find the exit of the maze you get to start the next level.

You can pause the game and restart a level as well as restart the entire game from a menu when you hit escape.  

Allow users to pick a character at the start.

Make a cool start screen with the game name “Closet Maze”, character selection, a settings button to open a settings menu to change things like sound and difficulty. Put basic game instructions on this page as well.
